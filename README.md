# Penultimate â€“ 6DOF Robotic Arm

**Penultimate** is a desktop-scale 6DOF robotic arm designed for precision control and real-time interaction. Built using standard-sized servos and a custom end effector, the project features full inverse and forward kinematics, a Python GUI interface, and modular Arduino firmware. 

This arm is intended for educational and research applications in robotics, embedded systems, and automation control.

## ðŸ“š Acknowledgement

The mechanical layout of this project was initially inspired by the **HowToMechatronics 6DOF Arduino Robotic Arm**.  
However, this version significantly diverges from the original with:

- A completely custom **Python GUI** for real-time control
- Fully implemented **inverse and forward kinematics**
- Use of PCA9685 Servo Driver
- Freshly written **Arduino firmware**
- Modified **servo setup** and **end effector**
- A modular structure suited for further research and development

This is an independent, portfolio-focused project built from the ground up.
